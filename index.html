            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In this lesson, we learned about version control systems. These are systems that help people, especially those working in groups, maintain the integrity of their data. These systems are very difficult to delete files from, so they help keep data stored all in one place without fear of it being lost. They also allow modifications to the data while still maintaining previous versions of said data. This allows users to revert back to previous versions without having to store several separate files on their own devices. These systems also let users see who made what changes and when, which is especially helpful in group settings. This topic interests me because I like working collaboratively. I didn't know that there were so many systems out there that could help people work on projects together while still keeping their data safe. This topic is relevant to the course because we do a lot of coding, and coding is almost never a one-person effort. Plus, it is helpful to be able to modify the code and revert to earlier versions if something goes wrong.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is one particular version control system that is helpful for people who want to save previous versions of their work. GitHub has its own sort of language and includes commands like 'git push', 'git add', and 'git commit'. It helps people who want to store their work and even share it with others, as there are several commands that make it easy for users to download other people's files and play around with (what is usually) their code. This works because GitHub is a version control system and downloading and modifying a file will not damage the original in any way, so nobody loses their work. This is interesting because, as I previously stated, I like things that can help me work collaboratively. Seeing other people's code is always a good way to learn more about your own. It is relevant to this class because we will be using GitHub as a remote repository, so it would be helpful to know our way around it.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local/Remote Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In this lesson, we also learned about local and remote repositories. These are places where people can store their files. Local repositories are most often on a local machine, and they provide one copy of the those particular files. Remote repositories are a way to back up files. They are not stored on a local machine so that if the local machine fails, the files will still have survived. GitHub is one example of a remote repository. Files can be pushed from a local to a remote repository, and this is why the command 'git push' is used in GitHub. This is interesting because I have had hard drives fail before, and having a backup copy of my files would have saved me a lot of frustration. In this course, we will be using remote repositories to easily share files between teacher and student. The backup is not as big of an issue since our local repository is also cloud-based and therefore our files would be safe with only Cloud9. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Collaboration</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Previously, I had thought coders and programmers worked alone. However, if this were the case, there would not be as great a need for services like GitHub or other Version Control Systems. As we learned in this lesson, collaboration is a large part of being a programmer. In all likelihood, more than one person will be involved in the creation of a program, either directly or indirectly. This is why being able to share files and keep previous versions around is so important to programmers, and why so many of them use various VCS systems. Sharing code is a great way to solve problems and learn even more about code. This is important to me because I like having multiple ways to learn things, and multiple things to learn from. Code-sharing is a great way to learn from different, unique sources. It is relevant to this course because we are learning how to be coders and programmers. We have to learn all parts of that process, including collaboration. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Using GitHub and Cloud9</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One part of our assignment for this lesson is to hook up our GitHub and Cloud9 accounts. This is putting an earlier concept into action. Cloud9 is acting as our local repository, while GitHub is going to be our remote repository. It is always helpful to see concepts that we've only previously heard about put into action. Connecting our local repository to our remote repository ourselves solidifies the concepts and makes them easier to understand. That is probably part of the reason we will be working with GitHub even if Cloud9 is cloud-based and will keep our files safe even if our local machines fail. This is interesting to me because I am a highly visual person, and seeing things work out right in front of my eyes is the best way for me to learn something. It is relevant to this class because putting learned concepts into action is something we'll have to do when we become independent programmers. </p>
